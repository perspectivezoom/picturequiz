# Picture Quiz

Picture Quiz was written as an interview project for a delivery company. The idea is for potential shoppers to be given this quiz so that the company knows if they're able to distinguish between household products.

Picture Quiz is written in CoffeeScript using the Backbone Marionette framework.
